# NightShiftHost
 A Discord bot I'm developing for use in our "Star Trek: Night Shift" discord.

## The Basics
This documentation will be pretty bare-bones at the moment. 

But, to be clear, I have no intention of hosting this bot publicly - you could use the code here to reproduce functionality but that is all I offer. You would need to create your own application through the Discord developer portal and get a client ID/secret to run this bot on your own.
